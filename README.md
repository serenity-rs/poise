# Poise
Poise is an opinionated Discord bot framework with a few distinctive features:
- edit tracking: when user edits their message, automatically update bot response 
- slash commands: completely define both normal and slash commands with a single function
- flexible argument parsing: command parameters are defined with normal Rust types and parsed automatically
